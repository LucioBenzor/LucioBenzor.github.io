Hey, I'm Lucio and I enjoy cybersecurity, the ever-widening world of system administration and the catalytic power of simple python scripts to automate routine tasks. I'm a cybersecurity consultant and enjoy working with companies to remediate vulnerabilities and coming up with a triage process and developing risk management strategies


Before that, I was a part of a UAT team acting as a general subject matter expert on a proprietary fingerprint web app where I cut my teeth on DR principles on an enterprise scale


I graduated Magna cum laude from the University of Georgia in 2012 with a degree in English and a concentration in rhetoric and composition
