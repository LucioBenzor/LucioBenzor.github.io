Hey, I'm Lucio and I enjoy cybersecurity, the ever-widening world of system administration and the catalytic power of simple python scripts to automate routine tasks. I'm a cybersecurity consultant and enjoy working with companies to patch vulnerabilities and develop risk management strategies based on industry best practices to secure their networks.


Before that, I sustained an enterprise fingerprint web app with the largest background check company in the US. I learned way too much
about the minutia of FBI, NMLS, and FINRA standards.


I graduated Magna cum laude from the University of Georgia in 2012 with a degree in English and a concentration in rhetoric and composition.
