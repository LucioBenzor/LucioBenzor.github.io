# This is my personal website

This is real neat in the way I was able to combine Github hosting coupled with a unique domain name and having everthing automatically transformed by Jekyll into a static site whenever I push this repository to GitHub.

Markdown is painless to learn and allows me to have full control over the style and layout of my site.
