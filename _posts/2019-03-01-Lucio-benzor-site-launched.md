Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.
A good resource on Mardown can be found [here on Github](https://help.github.com/en/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

Code test

'''python
print('Hello World!')
'''
