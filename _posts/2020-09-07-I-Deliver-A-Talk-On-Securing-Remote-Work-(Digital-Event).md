With the way the world is today, most working adults whose jobs can be done remotely are being asked to work remotely. On the IT side of things, great pains have
been made to accomplish this. There have been investments in VPNs and firewalls and consultants have been brought on board to help architecture how to accomplish
allowing employees to access the resources they've enjoyed at the office and continuing to be at their productive best.

Securing this connection has often been seen as an afterthought, if it's been a part of the conversation at all.

In [this webinar](https://nonprofits.tsi.microsoft.com/Securing-Remote-Work-Virtual-Event/), I go over the M365 stack and demo the security components of the productivity stack employers have always enjoyed. Here's a breakdown:

#### Enable remote access to applications
- Connect your on-premises infrastructure to the cloud
- Connect all apps to Azure Active Directory to enable single sign-on
- Turn on MFA with Conditional Access
#### Manage devices and applications
- Remotely provision and deploy new devices
- Enforce access policies on unmanaged devices with Intune
- Deploy and manage virtual desktop
#### Protect corporate resources
- Enable safe links and safe attachments
- Turn on Microsoft Teams Data Loss Prevention policies
- Protect web sessions with Microsoft Cloud App Security
